# OP Shopify App

A Shopify app with multiple extensions for enhanced customer experience. Currently includes SMS marketing consent collection with plans for additional checkout UI extensions, payment functions, and other Shopify extensions.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This project is structured as a **monorepo** containing multiple Shopify extensions:

- **SMS Checkout Extension** (`extensions/checkout-sms/`): Collects customer phone numbers and marketing consent during checkout
- **Future Extensions**: Additional extensions will be added as separate modules, including:
  - Checkout UI extensions (custom checkout components)
  - Payment functions (custom payment processing logic)
  - Admin UI extensions (custom admin interface components)
  - Theme app extensions (theme customization)
  - And other Shopify extension types

Each extension lives in its own folder under `extensions/` and can be developed independently.

### Adding New Extensions

Teammates can easily add new extensions using the Shopify CLI:

```bash
# From the project root
shopify app generate extension
```

This will prompt you to choose the extension type and create a new extension folder under `extensions/` with the proper structure and configuration.

**Supported Extension Types:**
- **Checkout UI Extensions**: Custom checkout components and forms
- **Payment Functions**: Custom payment processing logic
- **Admin UI Extensions**: Custom admin interface components
- **Theme App Extensions**: Theme customization and blocks
- **Web Pixel Extensions**: Analytics and tracking
- **And more**: The CLI supports all current Shopify extension types

### 3. Setup Shopify Configuration

The `shopify.app.toml` file is gitignored because it contains local tunnel URLs. Copy the template:

- **Configuration** in `shopify.extension.toml` (or appropriate config file)
- **Translations** in `locales/` directory (if applicable)
- **Build output** in `dist/` directory (gitignored)
- **Type-specific files** depending on extension type (e.g., `functions/` for payment functions)
